THE FOLLOWING ARE CHANGES NEEDED FOR BASE CMS

Stuff working on for resource site:
	Working on the BLAST submission form, write the javascript to interact with advanced options,
	add something into the database (or flat file?) to load the different options

Functionally needed:
	Create a publish queue for different thing boxes.
	Create an interface to upload files.
	Add way to delete user
	Update table structure to use pid as a foreign key...

Functionality that may be necessary:
	Design a way to add new pages and new page thing types... might be impossible as it 
	breaks the underlying purpose of the dev-focused CMS
